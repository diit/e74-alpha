A thing that does things. Oh! the things this thing can do.

(Demo Project)

## Limitations

- No Updating (Should have setup with Vue components at beginning, noth worth it now)

## Install & setup

1. composer install
2. npm install
3. bower install
4. Compile /public/scss/styles.scss -> /public/css/styles.css-scss (Note: Not compatiable with libsass, thus the lack of elixr)
